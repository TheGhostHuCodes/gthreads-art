# A green threads tutorial

This is the source of a short tutorial explaining how green
threads work. It uses the C language and some assembly, the
resulting implementation will work on x86-64 machines (both
Linux and Mac OS X, normally). You can find its source code
on my [gthreads](http://github.com/mpu/gthreads/)
repository.

I developed a small ad-hoc environment to automate the
generation of HTML code. It uses a slightly modified
Markdown language so even if files here end in ".md", Github
will not be able to render them all properly.

The tutorial is not yet published.

## Legal matter

All the code I wrote here is in public domain.
